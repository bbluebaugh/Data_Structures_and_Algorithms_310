# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_310
This repository is for my data structures and algorithms class.
This covers 4 projects:
  Spell Checker: A project which will check the spelling of input words from the keyboard and suggest the most likely possibilities given                   an input dictionary file.
  Duck Duck Goose: A project which simulates a game of duck duck goose utilizing the linked list and a random number generator for people                     getting "bored" with playing and leaving which inevitably results in the game ending when only two players are                              remaining.
  Huffman Code: A project which encodes and decodes huffman code based on input.
  Slang Translator: Takes an input and outputs a specific type of output based on the instructors given requirements.
